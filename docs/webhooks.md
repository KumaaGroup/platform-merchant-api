# Webhooks

Webhooks notify your server in real time when events occur — such as a payment being completed or an open banking transfer finishing. Instead of polling the API, you register a URL and the platform sends HTTP POST requests to it whenever a relevant event happens.

> **Event types renamed (2026-08):** the webhook event types have been restructured. `CARD_PAYMENT` was renamed to `PAYMENT` — existing `CARD_PAYMENT` webhooks were migrated automatically and keep delivering. The `OPEN_BANKING` event type was **removed and its webhooks deleted**: open banking transactions now emit `PAYMENT` events, so if you relied on an `OPEN_BANKING` webhook you must create a `PAYMENT` one. Refunds, chargebacks, and push-to-card disbursements now have their own event types (`REFUND`, `CHARGEBACK`, `PUSH_TO_CARD`) instead of riding `CARD_PAYMENT` — create a webhook per event type you consume.

## Why Webhooks Are Essential

The Platform Merchants API is **asynchronous** in many scenarios. When you create a payment, the initial response confirms the request was accepted, but the final outcome (captured, declined, etc.) is determined later during processing. The same applies to refunds, open banking transfers, and other operations.

**Webhook configuration is required** to reliably know when a payment has been captured or declined. Without webhooks, you would need to continuously poll the API for status changes, which is inefficient and may miss time-sensitive updates.

### Automatic Re-delivery

If your webhook endpoint is temporarily unavailable or returns a non-2xx status code, the platform automatically retries delivery. This ensures you do not miss events due to intermittent failures on your side.

## Create a Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/payments",
    "eventType": "PAYMENT",
    "enabled": true,
    "headers": [
      { "name": "X-Webhook-Secret", "value": "your-secret-value" }
    ]
  }'
```

### Request Fields

| Field       | Type    | Required | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `url`       | string  | Yes      | HTTPS endpoint to receive notifications (max 2048 chars) |
| `eventType` | string  | Yes      | Event type: `PAYMENT`, `REFUND`, `CHARGEBACK`, `PUSH_TO_CARD`, or `WALLET_TRANSFER` |
| `enabled`   | boolean | Yes      | Whether the webhook is active                     |
| `headers`   | array   | No       | Custom headers sent with each notification (max 5) |

### Custom Headers

You can attach up to 5 custom headers to each webhook. These are included in every notification request. Use them for authentication or routing.

| Field   | Type   | Description                        |
|---------|--------|------------------------------------|
| `name`  | string | Header name (max 256 characters)   |
| `value` | string | Header value (max 4096 characters) |

### Response (201 Created)

```json
{
  "id": "wh_abc123",
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/payments",
  "eventType": "PAYMENT",
  "enabled": true,
  "headers": [
    { "name": "X-Webhook-Secret", "value": "your-secret-value" }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00Z",
  "modifiedAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Constraints

- Only **one webhook per event type** per merchant. If you need to handle several event types (e.g. payments and refunds), create a separate webhook for each.
- The URL **must use HTTPS**. Plain HTTP endpoints are rejected.

## Event Types

| Event Type        | Triggered When                                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `PAYMENT`         | A payment status changes (authorized, captured, declined, etc.) — card payments, payments created via the [initialize flow](crypto-payments.md), [alternative payment methods](alternative-payment-methods.md), and [open banking](open-banking.md) transactions |
| `REFUND`          | A **refund** reaches a terminal status (`COMPLETED`, `DECLINED`, `REJECTED`) — see [Refunds — Webhook Notifications](refunds.md#webhook-notifications) |
| `CHARGEBACK`      | A **chargeback** recorded against one of your payments changes status (chargebacks share the refund status set — see [Refund Lifecycle](refunds.md#refund-lifecycle)) |
| `PUSH_TO_CARD`    | A [push-to-card disbursement](card-payments.md#push-to-card) status changes |
| `WALLET_TRANSFER` | A [Crypto Payment](crypto-payments.md) wallet top-up is captured (`COMPLETED`) or expires unconfirmed (`EXPIRED`) — see [Crypto Payments — Webhooks](crypto-payments.md#webhooks) |

## Webhook Object Statuses

The `status` field in the payload reflects the current state of the underlying object. The exact set of values depends on the event type; see the per-object lifecycle docs for the full state machines:

- `PAYMENT` — [Payment Lifecycle](card-payments.md#payment-lifecycle) for card payments, [Crypto Payments — Payment Lifecycle](crypto-payments.md#payment-lifecycle) for the initialize flow, [Open Banking — Transaction Lifecycle](open-banking.md#transaction-lifecycle) for bank transfers
- `REFUND` / `CHARGEBACK` — [Refund Lifecycle](refunds.md#refund-lifecycle)
- `PUSH_TO_CARD` — [Push-to-Card Lifecycle](card-payments.md#push-to-card-lifecycle)

Every webhook status corresponds to a stored record that you can fetch — via `GET /payment/record/{objectId}` for payments created through the initialize flow, or `GET /payment/{objectId}` for payments created through the deprecated direct endpoints. Duplicate-`externalId` submissions never produce a webhook — they are rejected synchronously with `409 Conflict` from the create endpoint (see [Idempotency](idempotency.md)).

## List Webhooks

```bash
curl https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Returns all webhooks configured for your merchant account.

## Get a Webhook

```bash
curl https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/webhooks/wh_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Update a Webhook

Use PATCH to partially update a webhook. Only include the fields you want to change.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/webhooks/wh_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enabled": false
  }'
```

### Updatable Fields

| Field     | Type    | Description                              |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `url`     | string  | New HTTPS endpoint URL                   |
| `enabled` | boolean | Enable or disable the webhook            |
| `headers` | array   | Replace custom headers (max 5)           |

The `eventType` cannot be changed after creation. To switch event types, delete the webhook and create a new one.

## Delete a Webhook

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/webhooks/wh_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Returns `204 No Content` on success.

## Best Practices

- **Verify the source.** Use custom headers (e.g. a shared secret) to verify that incoming requests are from the platform, not a third party.
- **Respond with 2xx quickly.** Your webhook endpoint should return a `200` or `202` status code promptly. Perform any heavy processing asynchronously after acknowledging receipt.
- **Handle duplicates.** Your endpoint may receive the same event more than once. Use the payment or transaction `id` to deduplicate.
- **Use HTTPS with a valid certificate.** Self-signed certificates are not supported.
