# Refunds

You can refund a completed card payment either fully or partially. Refunds are processed against the original payment using its platform-generated `id`.

## Create a Refund

```bash
curl -X POST https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/payment/pay_abc123/refund \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "externalId": "refund-order-001",
    "amount": 10.00
  }'
```

### Request Fields

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description                                              |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `externalId` | string | Yes      | Your unique identifier for this refund ([details](idempotency.md)) |
| `amount`     | number | No       | Amount to refund (minimum `0.01`). Omit for a full refund. |

### Full vs. Partial Refund

- **Full refund** — omit the `amount` field. The entire payment amount is refunded.
- **Partial refund** — provide an `amount` less than or equal to the original payment amount.

> **Note:** Partial refunds are not always available. Depending on the payment processing path, some payments only support full refunds. If you request a partial refund on a payment that does not support it, the API returns an error. When this happens, you can request a full refund instead.

### Response

Refunds are processed **asynchronously**. A successful request returns **200 OK** with the refund in `REQUESTED` status — the refund record is created immediately and then validated and processed in the background. The final outcome is delivered via [webhook](#webhook-notifications) and can also be polled via `GET /payment/{id}`.

```json
{
  "id": "ref_def456",
  "paymentId": "pay_abc123",
  "amount": 10.00,
  "createdAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00Z",
  "status": "REQUESTED"
}
```

For a full refund (request without `amount`), the response `amount` is the full amount of the original payment.

### Response Fields

| Field       | Type   | Description                              |
|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | string | Platform-generated refund ID             |
| `paymentId` | string | ID of the original payment               |
| `amount`    | number | Refund amount                            |
| `createdAt` | string | Timestamp of refund creation (ISO 8601)  |
| `status`    | string | Refund status                            |

### Status Codes

| Code | Meaning                                                            |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | Refund accepted and submitted for processing (`status: REQUESTED`) |
| 400  | Invalid request (e.g. non-positive or malformed `amount`)          |
| 404  | Payment not found                                                  |
| 409  | Duplicate `externalId` (see [Idempotency](idempotency.md))         |
| 422  | Partial refund not supported for this payment                      |

> **Note:** Whether the requested amount exceeds the remaining refundable amount is verified **asynchronously** during processing, not at submission. If the check fails, the refund transitions to `DECLINED` (see the [lifecycle](#refund-lifecycle) below) — you are notified via webhook rather than an HTTP error.

## Checking Refund Status

Refunds are returned as part of the payment details. Use the refund `id` to query its status:

```bash
curl https://sandbox-merchants-api.nonprod.paygate.systems/payment/ref_def456 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The response includes a `parentPaymentId` field linking the refund back to the original payment, and `type` will indicate it is a refund.

## Refund Lifecycle

A refund follows its own state machine, separate from the [card-payment lifecycle](card-payments.md#payment-lifecycle). Statuses such as `AUTH_REQUESTED`, `AUTHORIZED`, and `CAPTURED` never appear on a refund.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> REQUESTED: refund accepted (HTTP 200)
    REQUESTED --> PENDING: validation passed
    REQUESTED --> DECLINED: validation failed (e.g. refundable amount exceeded)
    PENDING --> APPROVED: ratio < threshold, or platform-initiated
    PENDING --> PENDING_APPROVAL: ratio >= threshold or threshold = 0
    PENDING_APPROVAL --> APPROVED: admin approves
    PENDING_APPROVAL --> REJECTED: admin rejects
    APPROVED --> COMPLETED: accepted by payment processor
    APPROVED --> DECLINED: declined by payment processor
    COMPLETED --> [*]
    DECLINED --> [*]
    REJECTED --> [*]
```

| Status             | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REQUESTED`        | Refund created and queued for validation                                                      |
| `PENDING`          | Validation passed (refundable amount verified) — being evaluated against the merchant's refund-ratio threshold |
| `PENDING_APPROVAL` | At or above the threshold (or threshold disabled) — awaiting manual review by platform administration |
| `APPROVED`         | Approved (auto or by admin), refund is being sent to the payment processor                    |
| `COMPLETED`        | Refund successfully processed by the payment processor (terminal)                             |
| `REJECTED`         | Refund rejected during manual review by platform administration (terminal)                    |
| `DECLINED`         | Refund failed validation (e.g. refundable amount exceeded, payment not refundable) or was declined by the payment processor (terminal) |

> **Note on `PENDING_APPROVAL`:** No action is required from the merchant — the platform-administration team will process the approval.

> **Note on platform-initiated refunds:** Refunds initiated directly by platform administration bypass the threshold evaluation and move straight from `PENDING` to `APPROVED`.

## Webhook Notifications

A `CARD_PAYMENT` webhook **is sent when a refund reaches a terminal status** — `COMPLETED`, `DECLINED`, or `REJECTED`. Intermediate statuses (`REQUESTED`, `PENDING`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`) do **not** trigger webhook notifications; poll `GET /payment/{id}` if you need to observe them.

The webhook payload identifies the refund by its `id` (as `objectId`) and your `externalId`:

```json
{
  "eventType": "CARD_PAYMENT",
  "objectId": "ref_def456",
  "externalId": "refund-order-001",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

For `DECLINED` refunds, the `responseCode` field carries the decline reason. See [Webhooks](webhooks.md) for configuration and delivery details.

> **Note on duplicate `externalId`:** a duplicate is always rejected synchronously with `409 Conflict` — no refund record is created and no webhook is sent. See [Idempotency](idempotency.md) for guidance on choosing `externalId` values.

## Best Practices

- **Use a unique `externalId` per refund** to ensure idempotency. If you retry a refund request with the same `externalId`, you'll receive a `409 Conflict` rather than a duplicate refund.
- **Check the original payment status** before requesting a refund. Refunds can only be issued against payments in `CAPTURED` status.
- **Track partial refunds carefully.** The total of all partial refunds must not exceed the original payment amount.
